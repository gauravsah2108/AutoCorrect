Implementing an autocomplete feature  


Trie Data Structure: Start by implementing a Trie data structure, also known as a prefix tree, to store a large collection of words efficiently. Each node in the Trie represents a character, and the edges represent the links between characters.

Insertion: Implement functions to insert words into the Trie. This involves traversing the Trie and adding new nodes as necessary.

Search: Develop a search function that takes a prefix as input and returns all the words in the Trie that have that prefix. Traverse the Trie until the prefix is matched, and then perform a depth-first search to collect all the words.

Auto-complete: Extend the search functionality to provide auto-complete suggestions as the user types. For each character entered, perform a search in the Trie starting from the current prefix and return a list of suggested words.

Weighted Suggestions: Enhance the auto-complete feature by assigning weights to each word in the Trie. The weights could be based on factors like word frequency or user preferences. Return the suggestions in descending order of their weights.

User Interface: Create a simple user interface to demonstrate the autocomplete feature. This could be a command-line interface where the user can enter a prefix, and the program will display the auto-complete suggestions.

Efficiency Optimization: Implement optimization techniques such as compression, pruning, and caching to improve the performance of the autocomplete feature, especially for large datasets.

Testing and Benchmarking: Develop test cases to validate the functionality of the autocomplete feature and measure its performance using various input sizes and scenarios

# Code Explain :-

Let's go through the code and explain its functionality step by step:

1. We start by including necessary header files:
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <vector>
   #include <algorithm>
   ```

2. Next, we define the TrieNode structure:
   ```cpp
   struct TrieNode {
       bool isEndOfWord;
       std::vector<TrieNode*> children;

       TrieNode() : isEndOfWord(false), children(26, nullptr) {}
   };
   ```
   - The `TrieNode` structure represents a node in the Trie. It contains a boolean flag `isEndOfWord` to indicate if the node marks the end of a word.
   - The `children` vector holds pointers to child nodes. Since we are working with lowercase English letters, we allocate space for 26 child nodes (one for each letter of the alphabet) and initialize them to `nullptr` using the constructor initializer list.

3. Next, we define the Trie class:
   ```cpp
   class Trie {
   public:
       Trie() {
           root = new TrieNode();
       }

       void insert(const std::string& word) {
           // ...
       }

       std::vector<std::string> autocomplete(const std::string& prefix) {
           // ...
       }

   private:
       TrieNode* root;

       TrieNode* getPrefixNode(const std::string& prefix) {
           // ...
       }

       void dfs(TrieNode* node, std::string currentWord, std::vector<std::string>& suggestions) {
           // ...
       }
   };
   ```
   - The `Trie` class represents the Trie data structure. It has member functions for inserting words, retrieving autocomplete suggestions, and other private helper functions.
   - The `root` member variable holds a pointer to the root node of the Trie.

4. We implement the `insert` function in the Trie class:
   ```cpp
   void insert(const std::string& word) {
       TrieNode* current = root;
       for (char c : word) {
           int index = c - 'a';
           if (current->children[index] == nullptr)
               current->children[index] = new TrieNode();
           current = current->children[index];
       }
       current->isEndOfWord = true;
   }
   ```
   - The `insert` function takes a word as input and inserts it into the Trie. It starts from the root node and traverses the Trie based on the characters of the word.
   - For each character `c` in the word, we calculate the corresponding index `index` by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a'. This index is used to access the child node in the `children` vector.
   - If the child node does not exist (`nullptr`), we create a new TrieNode and assign it to the `children` vector. Then, we move to the child node.
   - Finally, we mark the last node as the end of the word by setting the `isEndOfWord` flag to `true`.

5. We implement the `autocomplete` function in the Trie class:
   ```cpp
   std::vector<std::string> autocomplete(const std::string& prefix) {
       std::vector<std::string> suggestions;
       TrieNode* prefixNode = getPrefixNode(prefix);
       if (prefixNode != nullptr) {
           std::string currentWord = prefix;
           dfs(prefixNode, currentWord, suggestions);
       }
       return suggestions;
   }
   ```
   - The `autocomplete` function takes a prefix as input and returns a vector of autocomplete suggestions.
   - It first checks if the prefix exists in the Trie by
