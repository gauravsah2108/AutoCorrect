Implementing an autocomplete feature  


Trie Data Structure: Start by implementing a Trie data structure, also known as a prefix tree, to store a large collection of words efficiently. Each node in the Trie represents a character, and the edges represent the links between characters.

Insertion: Implement functions to insert words into the Trie. This involves traversing the Trie and adding new nodes as necessary.

Search: Develop a search function that takes a prefix as input and returns all the words in the Trie that have that prefix. Traverse the Trie until the prefix is matched, and then perform a depth-first search to collect all the words.

Auto-complete: Extend the search functionality to provide auto-complete suggestions as the user types. For each character entered, perform a search in the Trie starting from the current prefix and return a list of suggested words.

Weighted Suggestions: Enhance the auto-complete feature by assigning weights to each word in the Trie. The weights could be based on factors like word frequency or user preferences. Return the suggestions in descending order of their weights.

User Interface: Create a simple user interface to demonstrate the autocomplete feature. This could be a command-line interface where the user can enter a prefix, and the program will display the auto-complete suggestions.

Efficiency Optimization: Implement optimization techniques such as compression, pruning, and caching to improve the performance of the autocomplete feature, especially for large datasets.

Testing and Benchmarking: Develop test cases to validate the functionality of the autocomplete feature and measure its performance using various input sizes and scenarios
